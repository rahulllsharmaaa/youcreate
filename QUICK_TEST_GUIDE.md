# Quick Test Guide - Script Generation is Now Working!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The script generation was failing because the database tables didn't exist. 
**All migrations have been applied and sample data has been added.**

## 🧪 Test the Fix

### Option 1: Test from Command Line
```bash
npx tsx test-script-generator.js
```

**Expected Output:** A complete script starting with "Hey everyone! Today we are solving a question from IIT JAM for Mathematics..."

### Option 2: Test in the Application

1. **Open your browser** to the running application
2. **Open Developer Tools** (F12) → Console tab
3. **Navigate to the video creation interface**
4. **You should see:**
   - Exam: IIT JAM
   - Course: Mathematics
   - Question: "What is the value of lim(x→0) (sin(x)/x)?"
5. **Select script style** (Random or pick one of the 5 styles)
6. **Select video template** (pick from 4 templates)
7. **Click "Generate Script"**
8. **Check the console** for detailed logs:
   ```
   Starting script generation...
   Question data: {...}
   Course name: Mathematics
   Exam name: IIT JAM
   Using template ID: 1
   Generated script: Hey everyone! ...
   ```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Run these SQL queries to verify setup:

### Check Exams
```sql
SELECT * FROM exams;
```
**Should return:** IIT JAM

### Check Courses
```sql
SELECT * FROM courses;
```
**Should return:** Mathematics, Mathematical Statistics

### Check Questions
```sql
SELECT id, question_statement, question_type, used_in_video FROM new_questions;
```
**Should return:** 1 question about limits

### Check Videos Table
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM videos;
```
**Should return:** 0 (empty, ready for new videos)

## 🎯 What Happens When You Click "Generate Script"

1. ✅ Fetches course data from database
2. ✅ Fetches exam name (IIT JAM)
3. ✅ Converts math expressions to speech ("∞" → "infinity")
4. ✅ Selects a script template (1 of 5 rotating styles)
5. ✅ Formats options naturally ("Option A: 0. Option B: 1...")
6. ✅ Builds complete script with:
   - Introduction
   - Question reading
   - Timer instruction (5...4...3...2...1)
   - Answer reveal message
   - CTA for roadmap

## 🐛 If It Still Doesn't Work

Check browser console for errors. The enhanced logging will show exactly where it fails:

**Common Issues:**
- Network error → Check Supabase connection
- Empty script → Check console for template issues
- Database error → Verify migrations were applied

**Quick Database Check:**
```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;
```

**Should return:**
- chapters
- courses
- exams
- new_questions
- subjects
- topics
- units
- videos

## 📊 Database Status

**Current Data:**
- ✅ 1 exam (IIT JAM)
- ✅ 2 courses (Mathematics, Mathematical Statistics)
- ✅ 1 subject (Calculus)
- ✅ 1 unit (Differential Calculus)
- ✅ 1 chapter (Limits and Continuity)
- ✅ 1 topic (Limit of Functions)
- ✅ 1 question (ready to use)
- ✅ 0 videos (ready for generation)

## 🎬 Next Steps After Script Works

1. ✅ Generate script
2. ⏭️ Generate voice-over (uses ElevenLabs API)
3. ⏭️ Generate captions (automatic timing)
4. ⏭️ Render video (with Python backend or mock)

## 📝 Script Features Working

- ✅ 5 rotating templates (Engaging, Direct, Motivational, Professional, Friendly)
- ✅ Math expression conversion (natural speech)
- ✅ Option formatting for MCQ/MSQ
- ✅ Exam and course name insertion
- ✅ Countdown timer script (5...4...3...2...1)
- ✅ Clean, concise output (no verbose AI rambling)

## 🎨 Template System

**Script Templates (5 styles):**
1. Engaging Teacher Style
2. Direct and Clear Style
3. Motivational Style
4. Professional Academic Style
5. Friendly Tutor Style

**Video Templates (4 designs):**
1. Teal Gradient Professional
2. Warm Gradient Modern
3. Cool Blue Academic
4. Clean Minimal

Both are selectable in the UI!

## ✅ Everything Is Ready

The pipeline is fixed and working. You should now be able to generate scripts successfully!
